Pretty much I wrote this code in python then got chat to rewrite it for HTML/Java Script. 

TODO:
--> Make table custom event headders. This will require complex unit evaluation as sprints often display wind readings, and throws use different units. Maybe one day.

--> Make it run searches in parallel (speed it up)

--> Make it more integrated to results hub (so coppy the link or something to a race, instead of the physical start list)
